"""``CuratedPlane`` — Qdrant CRUD + lifecycle for :class:`CuratedKnowledge`.

Responsibilities (see [[04-data-model/curated-knowledge]] §Storage semantics):

- **Create** — write a curated row at ``state = "matured"``. Dedup is by
  ``(namespace, vault_path)`` (not similarity, unlike episodic): a second
  write for the same path is either a no-op (same ``body_hash``) or a
  supersession (different ``body_hash`` — old row → ``superseded`` with
  ``superseded_by``; new row gets ``supersedes = [old_id]``).
- **Get** — fetch one row by namespace + ``object_id``. Wrong-namespace
  reads return ``None`` (read-side namespace isolation).
- **Query** — dense retrieval scoped to a namespace, with two default
  predicates the curated plane adds on top of namespace + state: the
  bitemporal validity window ``valid_from <= valid_at < valid_until`` and
  ``state == "matured"`` (so a superseded or archived row never appears in
  a default query). Callers pass ``valid_at`` to time-travel.
- **Transition** — the only path allowed to mutate ``state``. Emits a
  :class:`LifecycleEvent` whose validator enforces the curated transition
  table (``matured ↔ superseded / archived``).

Vault filesystem behaviour — watcher debounce, write-log echo detection,
file-move / file-delete event handlers, frontmatter parsing,
``musubi-managed`` write authorization — is **not** owned here; it lives
in ``src/musubi/vault_sync/`` per slice-vault-sync.

Design notes:

- Qdrant point IDs are derived deterministically from a slice-specific
  ``uuid5`` namespace so the same KSUID always maps to the same point ID.
  The KSUID itself stays in the payload as ``object_id``.
- ``model_copy(update=...)`` skips validators in pydantic v2, so every
  state-mutating path round-trips through ``model_dump`` +
  ``model_validate`` — that's the only way to keep the monotonicity +
  lineage invariants honest.
- Bitemporal queries express "(valid_from is null OR valid_from <= t) AND
  (valid_until is null OR valid_until > t)" as two nested ``Filter``\\ s
  in ``must``, each with a ``should`` of the two branches. Qdrant supports
  this pattern natively — there is no need to filter rows in Python.

        STORED ``vault_path``, no ``namespace`` argument.

        The watcher is the primary caller: when a file is deleted from the
        vault the frontmatter is gone, so the watcher has no namespace
        context. This method does a cross-namespace exact-match scroll
        (Qdrant ``MatchValue``, NOT ``startswith`` / ``prefix`` / regex).
        Sibling and prefix-collision paths cannot match by construction.

        Uniqueness invariant: ``(namespace, vault_path)`` is unique per
        slice-vault-sync. ``vault_path`` alone is NOT unique across
        namespaces — a duplicate ``vault_path`` in two namespaces is a
        schema bug, but the public API MUST fail closed on it: returning
        an arbitrary match would let the watcher's archive-by-path
        target the wrong row. This method:

        - Returns ``Err(FindByVaultPathError(code='not_found'))`` when
          no row matches (the watcher's clean observable no-op).
        - Returns ``Ok(row)`` when EXACTLY one row matches.
        - Returns ``Err(FindByVaultPathError(code='multiple_matches'))``
          when more than one row matches — the caller MUST refuse to
          take destructive action.

        The scroll is bounded to ``limit=2`` (Yua VAULT-003 review
        binding): fetching the second match is sufficient to fail
        closed, and a limit of 2 is the smallest unconstrained value
        that still surfaces the duplicate case without pulling a
        potentially unbounded row count. Zero matches -> not_found;
        one match -> Ok; two matches -> multiple_matches. Anything
