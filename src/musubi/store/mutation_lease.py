"""DATA-001 / #530 — the attributable owner-token lease for concurrency-safe FULL-OBJECT updates.

RET-008 made access-writer-vs-access-writer concurrency safe and preserved the lease-owned access
fields across full-point upserts. It did NOT close the broader race: every full-object UPDATE path
(dedup-merge reinforce, curated same-id update, patch / supersede / concept-update) reads a whole
object and later writes it back, carrying the read-time snapshot of every field it did not mean to
change — so an unrelated concurrent mutation that lands in the read-to-upsert window is silently
overwritten.

Two Qdrant facts shape the fix (Yua, 2026-07-15):

1. A filtered ``set_payload`` is an atomic CAS, but its response exposes no trustworthy
   matched/modified count, and a readback of ``version == expected + 1`` is **not attributable** —
   two contenders proposing the same next version are indistinguishable. The only sound win signal
   is an **exact, unique, never-reused owner token** read back verbatim.
2. ``update_vectors`` is **not** filter-fenced. It must never run before the writer has uniquely
   proven ownership, or a payload-CAS loser could still overwrite the vector.

So this is a single-row, two-phase **attributable owner lease** on the dedicated
``update_lease_token`` payload field (``"own:<issued_us>:<nonce>"``; distinct from
``access_lease_token`` — different lifecycle, never overloaded):

1. **Acquire** — write ``own:<issued>:<nonce>`` fenced on the row being at the EXACT read
   ``version`` AND the token being empty, or on the EXACT observed EXPIRED token (crash takeover —
   never a blind steal).
2. **Attribute acquire** — read back; proceed only if the stored token is our exact token. This is
   the only win signal; a same-next-version contender fails it.
3. **Publish vectors (proven owner only)** — if the update changes vectors, ``update_vectors`` now.
   This is NOT safe (``update_vectors`` is unfenceable on the deployed Qdrant); it is best-effort and
   its atomicity is Phase-2 (see the scope note below). A loser never *reaches* it, but a stalled old
   owner's late write can still corrupt a newer vector.
4. **Commit — publish narrow changes + bump version + stamp a ``done`` token, in ONE ``set_payload``
   fenced on ``update_lease_token == our own``** — of ONLY the intended-change fields plus
   ``version = read_version + 1`` and ``update_lease_token = "done:<issued>:<nonce>"``. A
   stale/taken-over writer matches zero and cannot commit. Narrow write ⇒ unrelated fields compose;
   a same-field conflict retries against the fresh row.
5. **Attribute — our change landed IFF our EXACT ``done`` token is read back.** This is the ONLY
   success signal (mirrors ``store/access_lease.py``): ``{token==None AND version==read+1}`` is NOT
   attributable — a takeover that published a different change at the same next version would be
   falsely claimed as ours, silently losing our change. Absent/other ``done`` ⇒ retry.
6. **Clear** — ``set_payload(update_lease_token=None)`` fenced on our exact ``done`` token. A crash
   after the commit (expired ``done``) is self-healing: the change already committed (version bumped),
   so the next writer takes over the exact expired token and applies ITS change on top at the next
   version — the committed change is never re-applied or lost. An orphaned ``done`` token (no future
   writer) is inert operational plumbing (``exclude=True``, never surfaced).

**Scope — DATA-001 Phase 1 (this module): PAYLOAD-only concurrency safety.** The narrow fenced
``set_payload`` publish is concurrency-safe and crash-safe: it is the only commit point, it never
touches lease-owned access fields (so it composes with the RET-008 access lease), and unrelated
fields compose because the write set is narrow.

**The vector publish (phase 3) is NOT concurrency-safe or crash-atomic, and this is a KNOWN OPEN
ITEM (Phase 2 / #530).** Verified against the deployed Qdrant (server 1.15): ``update_vectors``'
``update_filter`` is **silently ignored** — a non-matching filter still overwrites the vector — so
a vector write **cannot be token-fenced**. Consequences that Phase 1 does NOT solve:

- a crash between the vector write and the payload publish leaves vectors mismatched with the
  committed content, and an unrelated takeover does not repair it;
- a stalled old owner's late ``update_vectors`` can land after a newer content+vector committed,
  corrupting it.

An earlier version of this docstring claimed the next owner "re-derives vectors from committed
content, converging." **That was false** — nothing here reconciles vectors. Only two call paths
change vectors (episodic reinforce with new content, curated same-id body change); their vector
atomicity is deferred to Phase 2 (immutable new point + fenced live-point pointer), which is the
completion gate for #530. Phase 1 preserves their current best-effort vector behavior and does not
claim it safe. Bounded retry + jitter; exhaustion is FAIL-LOUD (:class:`MutationLeaseConflict`);
a vanished row raises :class:`MutationRowVanished` (a ``LookupError``) so callers keep plane
not-found semantics.
