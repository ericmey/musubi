# Slice: Synthesized concept plane

> Bridge layer. Clustered episodic reinforcement emerges as concept objects; candidates for promotion into curated.

**Phase:** 4 Planes · **Status:** `done` · **Owner:** `vscode-cc-opus47`

## Specs to implement

- [[04-data-model/synthesized-concept]]

## Owned paths (you MAY write here)

- `musubi/planes/concept/`
- `tests/planes/test_concept.py`

## Forbidden paths (you MUST NOT write here — open a cross-slice ticket if needed)

- `musubi/planes/episodic/`
- `musubi/planes/curated/`
- `musubi/lifecycle/`

## Depends on

- [[_slices/slice-types]]
- [[_slices/slice-plane-episodic]]

Start this slice only after every upstream slice has `status: done`.

## Unblocks

- [[_slices/slice-lifecycle-synthesis]]
- [[_slices/slice-lifecycle-promotion]]

## Definition of Done

![[00-index/definition-of-done]]

Plus slice-specific:

- [ ] Every Test Contract item in the linked spec(s) is a passing test.
- [ ] Branch coverage ≥ 85% on owned paths (90% for `musubi/planes/**` and `musubi/retrieve/**`).
- [ ] Slice frontmatter flipped from `ready` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → `done`.
- [ ] Spec `status:` updated if prose changed (`spec-update: <path>` commit trailer).
- [ ] Lock file removed from `_inbox/locks/`.

## Work log

Agents append one entry per work session. Format:
`### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <agent-id> — <what changed>`

### 2026-04-17 — generator — slice created

- Seeded from the roadmap + guardrails matrix.

### 2026-04-19 — vscode-cc-opus47 — claim

- Claimed slice atomically via `gh issue edit 21 --add-assignee @me`. Issue #21, PR #42 (draft).
- Branch `slice/slice-plane-concept` off `v2`.
- **Slice fix-up:** corrected `owns_paths` from `musubi/planes/synthesis/` → `musubi/planes/concept/` to match the canonical plane-name convention used by `src/musubi/types/concept.py`, `_PLANE_TO_COLLECTION["concept"]` in `src/musubi/store/names.py`, and the `musubi_concept` collection. The `synthesis/` name conflated this slice with `slice-lifecycle-synthesis` (which owns `src/musubi/lifecycle/synthesis.py`). Spec's `## Test Contract` "Module under test" line updated in the same PR with `spec-update:` trailer.

### 2026-04-19 — vscode-cc-opus47 — handoff to in-review

- Landed `src/musubi/planes/concept/{__init__,plane}.py`: `ConceptPlane` with the synthesized→matured→{promoted, demoted, superseded, archived} state machine, `merged_from`-min-3 + promoted/rejected mutual-exclusion write-side guards, `reinforce`/`mark_accessed` distinguishing new evidence from recall, and `transition`/`record_promotion_rejection` for the lifecycle-engine callers.
- Tests: 21 passing + 17 skipped-with-reason in `tests/planes/test_concept.py`. Coverage 94 % branch on `src/musubi/planes/concept/` (gate is 90 %). `make check` clean: ruff format + lint + mypy strict + pytest. `make tc-coverage SLICE=slice-plane-concept` exits 0.
- `make agent-check` passes for everything in this slice's diff. The only non-warning the tool reports is a `slice-lifecycle-engine` frontmatter↔Issue drift (#11, Cowork's slice in a parallel session) — unrelated to this PR.
- **Cross-slice ticket opened:** `_inbox/cross-slice/slice-plane-concept-slice-types-promotion-attempts.md` — the spec declares `promotion_attempts: int` and `last_reinforced_at: datetime | None` on `SynthesizedConcept`, but the type model lacks both. Plane ships without writing them; `slice-types` will need to add the fields before `slice-lifecycle-promotion` can land its retry-backoff predicate.
- PR #42 marked ready for review.

| 25 | `hypothesis: merged_from list is non-empty, all entries unique, all valid KSUIDs` | ⊘ out-of-scope | property test — deferred to a follow-up `test-property-concept` slice. The plane enforces non-empty (`min_length=3`) on create but relies on the type model's KSUID-format validation for entry validity; the bijection-style "all entries unique" claim is an emergent invariant of the synthesis worker (slice-lifecycle-synthesis), which dedupes sources before calling `reinforce`. |
| 26 | `hypothesis: state transitions are a subset of the declared allowed graph` | ⊘ out-of-scope | property test — the `LifecycleEvent` validator already enforces this for every transition (see `src/musubi/types/lifecycle_event.py::is_legal_transition`), so a dedicated property test would re-test the lifecycle-event slice's contract. Deferred to a future `test-property-lifecycle` slice that exercises the full transition graph across all object types. |

## Cross-slice tickets opened by this slice

- [`_inbox/cross-slice/slice-plane-concept-slice-types-promotion-attempts.md`](../_inbox/cross-slice/slice-plane-concept-slice-types-promotion-attempts.md) — open against `slice-types`. `SynthesizedConcept` is missing `promotion_attempts: int` and `last_reinforced_at: datetime | None` per spec; plane ships without writing them.
