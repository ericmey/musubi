"""C6b - lifecycle Qdrant<->SQLite atomicity red contract (tests-only, ZERO src).

Slice: slice-c6b-lifecycle-qdrant-sqlite-atomicity (Issue #437). Design (accepted direction + Yua's fork
rulings + corrections A-J, 2026-07-13): a durable-intent transactional outbox behind a distinct
`LifecycleTransitionCoordinator` + `LifecycleOutbox` on a shared SQLite events+outbox DB. See
docs/Musubi/13-decisions/c6b-lifecycle-atomicity-design.md for the full state machine + crash matrix.

The contract is 22 behavior-shaped strict-xfail reds (R1-R22) + 3 guards (G1/G2/G3), each labeled:

  Phase-1 source acceptance (flip green with the coordinator/outbox implementation):
    R1  durable PENDING intent committed BEFORE the Qdrant mutation
    R2  SQLite unavailable at begin => Qdrant untouched + Err
    R3  transient Qdrant failure => Ok(Pending(operation_key,event_id)), no FINAL, reconciler completes
    R4  terminal failure => Err/ABANDONED, never a FINAL event
    R5  crash C1 (after PENDING, before Qdrant) => reconcile replays or abandons; no false FINAL
    R6  crash C2 (after Qdrant, before APPLIED) => reconcile readback-confirms -> APPLIED->FINAL
    R7  crash C3 (after APPLIED, before atomic FINAL txn) => reconcile redoes it; exactly one FINAL
    R8  finalize atomicity - FINAL event insert + outbox->FINAL in ONE SQLite transaction
    R9  idempotent replay => replaying a PENDING twice yields one FINAL + one effective apply
    R10 operation_key idempotency across CALLER retries => same logical request twice = one operation
    R11 single active intent per (collection,object_id) => concurrent begins serialize/reuse/reject
    R12 hard expected-version fence => stale expected => Err/abandon; stale replay abandons not clobbers
    R13 conditional apply + full readback (version+state+patch SHA, not version alone)
    R14 hard cap => at pending cap, begin => Err(cap_exceeded), Qdrant untouched
    R15 transient failure NEVER ABANDONED by attempt count => N transient failures keep it PENDING
    R16 reconciliation lease prevents double-processing
    R17 expired-lease reclaim
    R18 no poison-row starvation => one stuck transient row does not block other PENDING rows
    R19 outbox content never in logs/metric labels; row stores minimal patch + SHA, not arbitrary payload
    R20 rollback refuses on any nonterminal row + stops the worker first; terminal-row cleanup exists
    R21 caller outcome is three-way (Final/Pending/Err); Pending carries operation/event id
    R22 two DIFFERENT requested transitions race on one object => the loser cannot mutate/overwrite
    G2  coordinator callsite inventory is exactly the reviewed set
    G3  AST: the three-way TransitionOutcome is consumed, never dropped

  Defect closure (green ONLY when slice-h5-unify-state-mutation migrates every path):
    G1  mechanical AST guard: NO direct `state`-writing `set_payload` outside the coordinator

Tranche 1: **G1** (closure-gate) + its rule-discrimination proof (pure AST over src).
Tranche 2 (in progress): the Phase-1 behavior harness + reds, starting with **R1**. These drive the
future `LifecycleTransitionCoordinator` against an in-memory Qdrant + a real SQLite outbox. Each red is
strict-xfail today because the coordinator is unbuilt, but its decorator names the SPECIFIC defect it
targets and its assertion discriminates that behavior — so a WRONG coordinator leaves its own red
unflipped (proven at red-proof), not a single shared "coordinator absent" reason.

**Assumed Phase-1 coordinator surface** (documented here for Yua to confirm at source authorization):
`LifecycleTransitionCoordinator(client=<qdrant>, db_path=<shared events+outbox sqlite>)` with
`.transition(collection, object_id, namespace, expected_version, to_state, actor, reason, operation_key)
-> Result[TransitionOutcome, TransitionError]` and `.reconcile()`. A durable `lifecycle_outbox` row
(operation_key PRIMARY KEY, object_id, collection, target_state, expected_version, state, event_id, ...)
is committed BEFORE the Qdrant mutation. Tests inspect that table + Qdrant state directly.
